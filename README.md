# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project I have made a blog putting some info about places I visited.
There are 5 html, 1 css and 1 scss files.

index.html is home page.
lonar.html, badami.html, kollam.html and bhimbetka.html files decsribe about the 4 places.
You can navigate from any page from any page using links.

The html pages are divided into two columns using Bootstrap's grid model. Left column contains links for navigation as a list. Right column describes the place selected from left in a few paragraphs and images.

Images are arranged using card-deck class from Bootstrap components. There are also navigation buttons to go to Next and Prev post/page.

project0_0.css and project0_0.scss are stylesheets.
The stylesheet contains the style info satisfying the project requirements.

css properties used are: padding, border, background-color, text-align, margin, font-size, font-weight, color.

css selectors used are: (#id), (.class), (element.class), (.class , .class), (element element), (::selection), (:hover). hover is used for buttons.

@media query is used to shorten the navigation links on smaller screens.

scss file uses scss variables, nesting and inheritance.
